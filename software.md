The course makes use of a number of software packages that students
will install on their computers.
The following software are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## git and github
git is a system used for version control and collaboration.
You should have a github account and ensure that
git is installed on your computer.

## Bash shell and git software version control
The bash shell provides a programming environment that
is often used to manipulate files, install programs, and
basic data analysis.
The git version control system (along with the github website)
are widely used for sharing codes and collaborative development
of software.
Bash and git are part of Linux and Mac OSX.
Windows users should install gitbash. (See https://git-scm.com/download/win.)
Look [here](https://github.com/UWSEDS/uwseds.github.io/blob/master/software_windows_texteditor.md)
for more
details on the use of an editor with Windows for git.

### Mac OSX note: Some students reported an error with ``git``:
```
xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.
```
To fix this, do the following:

* Start a new Terminal
* Run the following command: ``xcode-select --install``
* Click ``Install``
* Click ``Agree`` to agree to the terms

### Windows user note:
Windows users should install the Software Carpentry recommended software:
Please follow these instructions on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8).
Make sure you install gitbash _and_ the text editor (SWCarpentryInstaller).

* Software Carpentry Installer: [https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/)


## Get the class notes
Use git to clone the repo for the lectures. (We're assuming that you git installed.)

- git clone https://github.com/UWSEDS/LectureNotes.git

## Python
We recommend that you use the most recent version of Python 3.  Earlier
versions of Python 3 work as well.  There are some differences between Python 2
and Python 3, and many systems only include Python 2.7 as a standard
installation.  A python installation for this course will be managed by the
[conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package management system, described below.

## Conda
Conda is a system for installing and otherwise managing python and other
software packages.  We recommend students use miniconda.  See
[http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
for instructions for downloading and installing miniconda for your OS, selecting
the Python 3 series installer.

Below are detailed instructions after you have installed miniconda:

1. Update conda's listing of packages for your system:
- $conda update conda
3. Install ipython notebook and its requirements:
- $ conda install notebook
4. Navigate to the directory containing the course material. For example:
- $ cd ~/LectureNotes/02-Python-and-Data
5. Type ipython notebook in the terminal to start the notebook:
- $ ipython notebook

If everything has worked correctly, it should automatically open the notebook
server in your default browser. 

## Text editor
Students will select a text editor of their choice, such as
Notebook (Windows), vim (all platforms), and sublime (all platforms).
A text editor is different from word processing programs,
like MS Word, in that text editors often recognize
program syntax and do no formatting.



If you don't already have a favorite text editor, we recommend installing either [atom](http://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), which are both available for all platforms.
