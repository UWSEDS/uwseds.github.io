The course makes use of a number of software packages that students will install on their computers.
The following software are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**Please try to install all of this software on your computer before the first day of class.**

## 1. Ensure you have access to a Unix-style terminal.

### MacOS and Linux operating systems

Use your operating system's program search (MacOS: spotlight search, Cmd-Space. Ubuntu: Ubuntu button in upper-left corner) up and search for `Terminal`.

You should get a window with a command prompt. Command prompt might have different words / characters, followed by a `$` and cursor for text input. Late 2018 and newer MacOS computers default to `zsh` instead of `bash`. This difference will briefly be covered in class, but you can run `bash` [+ Enter] in the terminal if you choose to use that instead.

### Windows 11 and Windows 10, version 1607+ (Windows Linux Subsystem)

All Windows users should note that the Windows command lines, cmd and PowerShell, differ greatly from the ``bash`` or ``zsh`` command prompt that software developers commonly use. From here on out, we will use "terminal" to refer to the Unix-style unless clearly and explicitly stated otherwise.

Note: Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL2, or the older WSL) is preferred over older Git Bash solution below. It's faster, more similar to what you'll see in class and has a more complete set of Unix programs.

Before trying the suggestions below, try opening the Windows Store (from your start menu) and search for Ubuntu 22.04.  It will be a free download and installing it "will just work" for most recent versions of Windows 11 on relatively new hardware. 

If installing from the Windows Store does not work, we suggest following these instructions for [installing a WSL distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Some tips:
* We highly suggest using the Ubuntu 22.04 distribution. Ubuntu is one of the more beginner-friendly Linux distros and the instructor is also able to record screen captures for this setup.
* We suggest setting your Linux distribution username and password to match your Windows ones. This will reduce confusion!

## 2. Ensure that Git is installed.

Type `git --version` into the terminal. If the terminal prints out any version number, you are successful. For example, my Macbook Pro returns `git version 2.24.1 (Apple Git-126)` and my Windows 10 WSL system returns `s`.

### Mac OS Note: Some students reported an error with ``git``:
```
xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at
'/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option
in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.
```
To fix this, do the following:

* Start a new Terminal
* Run the following command: ``xcode-select --install``
* Click ``Install``
* Click ``Agree`` to agree to the terms

### Github.com

Also create a Github.com username. This is a free account. We will discuss more on the Version Control I lecture.

## 3. Installing Python via Anaconda / Miniconda
We recommend that you use the most recent version of Python 3.  Earlier versions of Python 3 work as well.  There are some differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and many systems only include Python 2.7 as a standard installation.  A Python installation for this course will be managed by the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package management system, described below.

Anaconda is a system for installing and otherwise managing Python and other software packages. Anaconda installs  See [http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) for instructions for downloading and installing miniconda for your OS, selecting the Python 3 series installer.

Below are detailed instructions **after** you have installed Miniconda (or the full Anaconda):
1. Update conda's listing of packages for your system: $``conda update conda``
2. Install Jupyter notebook and its requirements: $``conda install jupyter notebook``
3. Test that Jupyter notebooks run using the terminal to start the notebook: $``jupyter notebook``

If everything has worked correctly, it should print a URL to the console that opens an empty notebook. Depending on settings, it may automatically open the notebook server in your default browser.

## 4. Install a terminal text editor.
We highly suggest installing Nano, an easy to use text editor in the terminal.

### Linux operating systems (including WSL and Git Bash on Windows!)
For Ubuntu distributions, try $`sudo apt-get install nano`. For others, $`yum install nano`.

### MacOS operating system:
MacOS doesn't have a pre-installed package manager for their Unix programs. The best option is Homebrew with [full instructions on the website](https://brew.sh/).

Students can also select a graphical text editor of their choice, such as Notebook (Windows), vim (all platforms), and Sublime (all platforms). A text editor is different from word processing programs, like MS Word, in that text editors often recognize program syntax and do no formatting.

If you'd also like a graphical text editor but don't already have a favorite, we recommend installing either [atom](http://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), which are both available for all platforms.
## 5. Install Visual Studio Code \(VS Code\)

[Visual Studio Code \(also known as VS Code\)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a graphical code editor that can be customized and extended with a vast library of open-source extensions.
After installing VS Code, install [the Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [the Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

If you frequently use R, you can install [the R language extension too](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r).
