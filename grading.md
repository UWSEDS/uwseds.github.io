## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 35%

Class participation: 15%

Course project: 50%

## Homework grading

There will be 4 homework assignments with individual scores and a group homework assignment.
The homework will be assigned in the first part of the course.
To receive full credit, homework must be posted by 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the due date.
The due date for homework is specified in the class syllabus.
Two points will be deducted from homework received up to a week after its due date.
No credit will be given for homework more than one week late (unless there is special permission
from the instructors).
The instructors will respond to the homework as a github issue.
You will have one week from the posting of the instructor's issue to revise your homework.

__Note that we will not help you with your homework regrades unless we saw you in office hours before the due date.__ We will keep track. The regrade opportunity is to aid in your learning, not to procrastinate. __PLEASE__ use us during office hours in a timely manner, before the homework is due.

Homework should be submitted using Github Classroom.

1. Click the link for the homework on the syllabus page. This will create a repository for you.

1. Clone the repository on your machine.

1. Do the homework on your machine.

1. ``git add`` new files that you create in your repo.

1. ``git commit`` and ``git push`` to submit your homework. You may do many pushes as long
as they are before the homework due date.

## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on project related presentations, polling in class, and participation in the Ed Discussion.

We expect that everyone has presented part of their group's presentation (tech review, practice presentation / summary, final presentation).

## Course Project

[Description of Class Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14XfgSuko_hfYbNBq8agz31CxnmIJkw2Iz8yW0cs-mSY/edit?usp=sharing)

Projects will be graded based on:
(a) the final presentation, (b) documentation
(especially function and design specifications), (c) the features implemented,
and (d) code quality.
(Details of the grading rubric can be found
in the Projects tab.)
Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments
for significant discrepancies in
the relative contributions of team members.
The latter will be assessed by commit logs and by
a survey students will submit
at the end of the quarter.

## Using AI Assists (Copilot, GPT, Cursor, ...)

* We encourage you to do the homeworks without using AI assists. Education
literature on this is still very new, but it suggests that AI assists can limit
learning and we would like you to learn the basic skills that are taught in the
homeworks so that you are well prepared to utilize AI assists in the future. The
reward of using AI assists can be negative as their output is effectively opaque
to you, without requisite basic software design and programming skills that the
homeworks gently provide. There are only a handful of homework assignments.
There is a question in each homework where we ask you to describe your process
for doing the homework. If you do decide to use AI Assists in the homeworks,
we ask that you use that question to descibe to us what tool you used and how
you used it so that we can understand the diversty of approachs and adapt our
class materials in the future.

* You are welcome to investigate AI assists for your class project.  AI assisted
tooling is being used in many cases to build software and if you are interested
in them this class can provide an opportunity to experiment with them. You
should become comfortable with the best tools for the task at hand, once you are
able to interpret and evaluate its output. We do ask that you share how you used
the AI assists in your documentation and class stand ups so we can all learn
about new tools.

* Ultimately, You are responsible for what you turn in/publish. If it contains
errors as a result of using AI assists, you are still responsible for those
errors. This is true in your career as well as your academics.
