[Description of Class Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14XfgSuko_hfYbNBq8agz31CxnmIJkw2Iz8yW0cs-mSY/edit?usp=sharing)

Deadlines:

* Wed. 12/14 1-3pm: Project Presentations (6th Floor, Physics and Astronomy Building)
* Thurs. 12/15 8am: Project repositories are finalized

Projects will be graded based on:
(a) the poster presentation, (b) documentation
(especially function and design specifications), (c) the features implemented,
and (d) code quality.
(Details of the grading rubric can be found
in the Projects tab.)
Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments
for significant discrepancies in
the relative contributions of team members.
The latter will be assessed by commit logs and by
a survey students will submit
at the end of the quarter.
